# OpenGL-Sandbox
(Description is AI generated)This repository is my OpenGL sandbox, where I experiment with and learn OpenGL while focusing on abstracting code to improve my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project serves as a playground for implementing rendering techniques, managing OpenGL resources.
