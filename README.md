# OpenGL-Sandbox
(Description is AI generated)

This repository is my OpenGL sandbox, where I experiment with and learn OpenGL while focusing on abstracting code to improve my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project serves as a playground for implementing rendering techniques, managing OpenGL resources.

Goals:
 - To deepen my understanding of OpenGL and computer graphics.
 - To practice writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code.
 - To build a foundation for more advanced graphics programming projects.

Technologies Used:
 - OpenGL: Core rendering API.
 - GLFW: Window and input management.
 - Glad: OpenGL function loading.
 - GLM: Mathematics library for graphics.
 - CMake: Build system for cross-platform compilation.

How to Use:
 - Clone the repository.
 - Build the project using CMake.
 - Run the executable.

Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or use this project as a learning resource!
